*The app does not require any additional dependencies and packages. Just download and open the index file.

Steps on running the application:
1. Download the zip file from the github repository 
2. Extract the zipfile
3. Navigate to the folder and locate the "index.html"
4. Double click the file to open locally in the browser
5. Toggle the filters to load news according to news category and countries.

-The news can be viewed by clicking the button "read more", this will redirect to a new page with the original article.

*The repetetive picture saying "breaking news" was done to replace the fetching of null images from the api (NewsApi) to avoid
displaying the alternative image name.
